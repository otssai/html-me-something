            <p>I took a trip to London in February 2020. It was my first time being in Europe. What impressed me most was the British Museum. You can easily spend several days in there and it costs &pound;0 to get in! I spent about two days in there.</P>
            <h2 id='blueSubtitle'>The Main Entrance</h2>
            <p>The architecture of the British Museum itself is quite beautiful. Here is what the main entrance looks like:</p>

            <h2 id='blueSubtitle'>Ancient Greece</h2>
            <p>There is a roomful of statues from Parthenon in the British Museum. Parthenon was completed in 432 BC by ancient greeks, and was partially destroyed in 1687 due to fire. Half of the palace survived, and the British Museum has about a half of the pieces that survived the fire. Here are some of the statues you see in the Parthenon room:</p>

            <h2 id='blueSubtitle'>Assyria</h2>
            <p>I knew nothing about Assyria before going into the British Museum but I found this pair of human-headed winged bulls built for the Assyrian king Sargon II (721-705 BC) very interesting. These bulls were considered magic guardians against misfortune.</p>

            <h2 id='blueSubtitle'>Ancient Egypt</h2>
            <p>The British Museum also has a large collection of items from ancient Egypt. The first photo below is a statue of a man. The second and the third photos are paintings depicting the lives of rich ancient Egyptians.</p>
